Techie by day! Techie by night! Techie at heart!

This is my second blog on the internet; first one was on [geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) in late 90s. Yes, I'm a grey bearded programmer.

&amp; thatâ€™s me a decade back :D â€“&gt;

I will be journaling my journey/learnings/projects in the Programming/Sotware world here. Feel free to tag along...
