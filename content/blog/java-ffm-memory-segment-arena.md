# TL;DR

Javaâ€™s Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API enables safe, high-performance interaction with native code and memory, improving interoperability with other languages and access to low-level system resources. Working code samples are available on <a href="https://github.com/rohanray/roray-dev-site/tree/main/code/java-ffm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

# Overview

<p>
The Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API in Java, finalized in JDK 22 with JEP 454, provides a robust and safe mechanism for Java code to interact with foreign functions (native code) and foreign memory (memory outside the Java heap).
</p>

<p>
The FFM API is designed to be a safer, more efficient, and more user-friendly alternative to the Java Native Interface (JNI). JNI is known for its complexity and potential for introducing errors, whereas FFM aims to provide a more "Java-first" programming model for native interoperability.
</p>

<p>
The FFM API introduces several key concepts and components that facilitate foreign function and memory access in Java:
</p>

1. **Memory Segments**: A memory segment is a contiguous block of memory that can be accessed by Java programs. The FFM API provides a way to create and manage memory segments, allowing developers to allocate and deallocate memory as needed.

2. **Arena Allocation**: The FFM API introduces the concept of arenas, which are memory pools that can be used for efficient allocation and deallocation of memory. Arenas help reduce fragmentation and improve performance when working with native memory.

3. **Value Layouts**: Value layouts define the memory layout of data structures in a platform-independent way. The FFM API allows developers to create value layouts for both Java and foreign types, ensuring compatibility between the two.

4. **Memory Access**: The FFM API provides a set of APIs for reading and writing data to memory segments, making it easy to manipulate native data from Java.

5. **Foreign Functions**: Foreign functions are native functions written in languages like C or C++ that can be called from Java. The FFM API provides a way to define and invoke foreign functions, enabling seamless integration between Java and native code.

>Note: _While the primary use case of the Java Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API is to call C functions from Java (downcalls), it also supports the reverse: calling Java functions from C (upcalls). This is particularly useful for scenarios like C callbacks, where a C library needs to invoke a function provided by Java code._

By leveraging these components, developers can build high-performance applications that take advantage of native libraries and system resources while maintaining the safety and ease of use that Java provides.

**Explanation**
<ul class="explanation">
<li>Incubator Phase: The initial steps of the FFM API were as incubating features, meaning they were experimental and subject to change. These releases introduced the core concepts like memory access and foreign function invocation. JEP 434 mentions that the FFM API was in its incubator phase in JDK 17 and JDK 18.</li>
<br>
<li>Preview Phase: In the preview phase, the API's design and implementation were complete, but still subject to potential changes based on user feedback. OpenJDK JEP 424 describes the Foreign Function & Memory API as a preview API in JDK 19.</li>
<br>
<li>Finalized: In JDK 22, the FFM API was declared stable and ready for production use, removing the need for preview flags and providing a more robust and reliable native interoperability solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Key Enhancements: This section highlights the significant changes and refinements introduced in each version of the FFM API as it evolved.</li>
</ul>
