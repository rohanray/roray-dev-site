Why Zola? 

I did try [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and love it! However, I found [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) much simpler.

This site uses [tabi](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/) theme and is hosted on my personal VM behind a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) proxy. Here's how you can quickly build yours:

1. Install Zola on your machine depending on your platform <a href="" from [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) 

2. Go to tabi-start <a href="https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a>

3. Follow along <a href="https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

*Check [tabi's documentation](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/) to learn about all features.*

_That's it for today!_
