## Hello, I'm Rohan Ray – Architecting Performance and Scale.

Welcome to **roray.dev** - my personal blog!

With **over 17 years of hands-on experience** under my belt, I am a dedicated software engineer specializing in high-performance, high-scale systems. My career has spanned demanding technical environments across **Telecommunications, eCommerce, Retail, Healthcare, Banking, and Capital Markets.**

### My Core Focus: Performance and Scale

My true passion—and the focus of this blog—is tackling the most complex challenges in **system performance and scaling**. I thrive on designing, debugging, and deploying robust architectures that can sustain massive traffic loads and evolving business needs. This site is dedicated to sharing the advanced technical challenges I solve outside of my daily role.

My most significant technical achievement to date is the founding of <a href="https://www.recaho.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**recaho.com**</a>, a platform I built that successfully scaled to serve **over a million Daily Active Users (DAU)**. It is a testament to the engineering principles I advocate.

Through this blog, I aim to share solutions and insights that can benefit others tackling similar high-stakes, high-scale engineering hurdles.

### Beyond the Code

When I step away from the terminal, I focus on recharging:

* **Family Inspiration:** My lovely daughter, Myra, keeps my mind agile. Her endless curiosity and **quest for knowledge** constantly inspire a renewed sense of learning.
* **Recreation:** You can find me unwinding by playing **FIFA** on my Xbox or engaging in the strategic patience of a game of **Snooker** with friends.
